# This is the landing page for the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library Class: Python and Omics Data

This class is designed to help you conceptualize how to design Python scripts that perform useful data processing tasks, using classic microbiology examples. In other words, we will be talking about basic manipulation of DNA and RNA sequences. I will also introduce you to a useful website that will help you continue builing skills in this area, Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/). 

If you need a Python environment to use during this class (if have not installed Python before the class has started, or you are not comfortable with the Python console, or your integrated development environment, etc.), please follow the preceeding button to launch a blank Google Collab notebook.
